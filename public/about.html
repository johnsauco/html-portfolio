<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is John Edward Sauco.
  I hold a bachelor's degree in Electronics Engineering which was awarded to me by Wesleyan University-
  Philippines in Cabanatuan in 2013. I took and passed the Electronics Engineer and Electronics Technician Examinations in
  December 2013. These facts provide the evidence that I have a quite adequate command to work in
  a company like yours.</p>

<p>As far as my private life is concerned, I am from a middle-class nuclear family which is composed of five
  members: my parents, my younger brothers and I. My father is an agriculturist. My mother is a
  businesswoman who deals caters. My brothers are accountant and electrical engineer. My family life is
  calm and steady. My parents love their children and hold great expectation that their children can
  establish their own career independently and live a happy life. Fortunately, up to now I have not
  disappointed them. My hobbies include movies, music and sports. I am an enthusiastic, initiative and
  interesting person although I can be straightforward and not very prudent in complicated situations.
  However, I learn from experience quickly.</p>

<p>I can confidently say that I am ready for my future. But I am looking for a good opportunity in which I
  can make a contribution to the welfare of the company which I will work for. Along with this experience,
  I hope to develop myself to keep pace with the changes of the era in my profession.</p>
